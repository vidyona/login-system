JSON Web Token aka JWT

server will generate a user specific token and sends into browser client on logging moment

Browser will store this token in HTML5 Local Storage or Session Storage and will be sending this token with every request

for every refresh, browser code can check for the availability of this token in Local Storage or Session Storage

*Advantage of this approach is that the server doesn't have to keep track of issued token and is able to extract data from token if needed

*This JWT is widely used in authenticating Web applications developed using advanced Javascript frameworks : Angularjs or Reactjs(with supporting libraries)
